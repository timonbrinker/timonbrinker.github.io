      <h2>  Research Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Market failures in critical areas such as climate change mitigation, refugee distribution, and
        the integration of new technologies pose significant challenges to our global society. My
        research aims to address these challenges through the lens of market design, focusing on
        auctions, matching mechanisms, and strategy-proofness, with a particular interest in their
        application to real-world problems and the incorporation of artificial intelligence.
        I am motivated by the urgent need for efficient and equitable mechanisms that can handle
        the complexities of modern economies. By investigating how to design markets that optimize
        resource allocation while remaining transparent and understandable to participants, I hope
        to contribute solutions with both practical and ethical significance.
        In this statement, I outline my past work and future research plans in three interconnected
        areas: matching mechanisms for refugee distribution and ride-sharing services, the design
        of mechanisms for global challenges like climate change, and the role of obvious strategy-
        proofness in the context of AI-assisted decision-making.

      <h2>  Reseach Proposal: Two-sided-matching with exogenous capacities in the context of refugee allocation</h2>
      <p>
        We develop a model for refugee allocation in the European Union that leverages
        tradable quotas and two-sided matching mechanisms to address inefficiencies in
        existing asylum policies. The model introduces a dynamic matching framework
        where both countries and refugees express preferences, allowing for adjustments
        through an auction-based system that allocates quotas based on capacity and cost
        considerations. By incorporating both theoretical and policy dimensions, we eval-
        uate the proposed mechanisms’ efficacy and ethical implications, offering insights
        into more equitable and sustainable refugee distribution strategies.

      <h2>On the Move: A Study of Dynamic Matching Mechanisms in BlaBlaCar’s Mobility Marketplace</h2>
      <p>
        We develop a model for dynamic ride-sharing allocation in the context of BlaBlaCar’s mobility marketplace. Our approach integrates queuing theory and two-sided matching algorithms to optimize the matching of drivers and riders under time-varying conditions. By incorporating a stochastic framework, we account for the heterogeneity of arrival and departure rates, allowing for realistic representation of market dynamics. The proposed models explore alternative matching strategies, including patient and greedy algorithms, and evaluate their efficiency through empirical simulations. This analysis offers insights into policy adaptations that enhance ride-sharing platforms’ performance while addressing limitations of current systems, aiming for increased sustainability and user satisfaction.
